## Purpose

It never hurts to review your math skills. This game can help with your ability to quickly solve math problems with small numbers. It is currently set to use the four basic math functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The inputed numbers are 1-20. It can however be easily adapted to include different numbers and functions. Enjoy!

## Instructions

Click two number buttons and a math function to create the target number. Number buttons can be used twice. Three incorrect answers will restart the game. Try to see how many questions you can get.
